## Refold
Refold is a commandline tool with similar functionality to unix `fold`.

Refold by default uses the unicode split property to determine where it can 
split text. Additionally, it will automatically detect line prefixes and empty 
lines. This makes wrapping comments or doc-comments a breeze.
